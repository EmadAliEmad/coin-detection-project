# Coin Detection Project

This project detects coins in an image using OpenCV and estimates their total value. The application processes an image, identifies coins, and calculates the total value based on predefined coin types (e.g., pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters).

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmadAliEmad/coin-detection-project.git


## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have a folder containing images of coins (e.g., `coin_photographs/`).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python detect_coins.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
